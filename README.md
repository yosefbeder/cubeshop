# Cubeshop

A simple E-commerce app made with [commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/).

I had a lot of fun programming this app.

I just had one problem which is that commerce SDK type declarations doesn't work well with the ways mentioned in the docs, so I had to change them which wasn't a good development experience.

In this project I tried to practice git as much as I can.
